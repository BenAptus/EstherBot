    "HELLO": "Greetings!\nI am Ben Bolin's personal bot. Ben is a law student in Kansas City. \n![Ben](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BenAptus/EstherBot/master/img/Bolin.jpg.jpg)\nWant to know more about bots or Ben? %[Learn about Ben](postback:Learn_about_Ben) %[Learn About Bots](postback:Learn_About_Bots) %[One random fact!](postback:random_fact)",

    "LEARN ABOUT BOTS": "I thought so. \n! [capgif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BenAptus/EstherBot/master/img/capgif.gif)\nWant to learn how to make chatbots? Or how chatbots are the future? %[How to make chatbots](postback:How_to_make_chatbots) %[Chatbots in detail](postback:Chatbots_in_detail)", 
    "HOW TO MAKE CHATBOTS": "There are many ways to make a chatbot (and a million guides). Do you want the easy way or the hard (and rewarding) way? %[Easy Way](postback:easy_way) %[Hard Way](postback:hard_way)",
    "EASY WAY": "I (the bot) am inspired by an example bot made by Esther Crawford! This article details the steps to create your own chatbot. \n!%[EstherBot](http://bit.ly/229jelu).\nWould you like to see other bots? Or are you done? %[Go Back](postback:Go_Back) %[There Are More Bots?!?](postback:There_Are_More_Bots?!?)",
    "HARD WAY": "Here is the hard(ish) way! This will get you a facebook messenger bot that echos what someone says. Its a great start! Then expand on the code to make the bot respond to specific words or phrases. \n![Program Pair](http://bit.ly/ProgramPair)\nWould you like to see other bots? Or are you done? %[Go Back](postback:Go_Back) %[There Are More Bots?!?](postback:There_Are_More_Bots?!?)",
    "THERE ARE MORE BOTS?!?": "Haha. I know bots are cool. There are bots that will tell you the weather and bots that will tell you the news. Wanna try? \nIn facebook, go to the searchbar, and try one of the following: \n 1-800-flowers.com, CNN, Wall Street Journal. Click on 'Message' and see! \nAlright, are you satisfied?  %[Go Back](postback:Go_Back)",
    "GET BOTTY WITH ME": "Bots are the future. Technology companies are now roaring about 'app fatigue', or the fact that people download apps but forget to use them or delete them. Meanwhile apps like messenger, slack, instagram and otherwise grow in popularity. \n![graph1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BenAptus/EstherBot/master/img/messaging-apps-retain-more-users-and-are-used-more-frequently-than-other-apps.jpg)\nFacebook, Google, H&M and more are betting chatbots (like this) are the future of interacting with clients because folks are more likely to keep these apps installed. Granting a continuous 'in' to clients. \nWant to check out other bots? %[More bots!](postback:more_bots) %[take me to the main menu](postback:take_me_to_the_main_menu)",
