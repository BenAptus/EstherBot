Or how chatbots are the future? %[How to make chatbots](postback:How_to_make_chatbots) %[Chatbots in detail](postback:Chatbots_in_detail)", 
    "HOW TO MAKE CHATBOTS": "There are many ways to make a chatbot (and a million guides). Do you want the easy way or the hard (and rewarding) way? %[Easy Way](postback:easy_way) %[Hard Way](postback:hard_way)",
    "EASY WAY": "I (the bot) am inspired by an example bot made by Esther Crawford! This article details the steps to create your own chatbot. %[EstherBot](http://bit.ly/229jelu)\nWould you like to see other bots? Or are you done? %[Go Back](postback:Go_Back) %[There Are More Bots?!?](postback:There_Are_More_Bots?!?)",
    "HARD WAY": "Here is the hard(ish) way! This will get you a facebook messenger bot that echos what someone says. Its a great start!

You should connect with Ben and talk about chatbots! %[I want to chat with Ben](postback:I_Want_to_Chat_with_Ben) %[Go Back](postback:Go_Back)",
    "CHATBOTS IN DETAIL": "In short, bots can and will solve more problems, connect more people, and do more than any website or app.\nGet this: technology companies in Silicon Valley call the phenomina 'app fatigue', people download an app and either forget about it or don't use it. Social apps on the other hand are shown to be used more often and retained.\n![graph1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BenAptus/EstherBot/master/img/messaging-apps-retain-more-users-and-are-used-more-frequently-than-other-apps.jpg)\nEnter chatbots, short form artificial intelligence that can do anything an app can do but personalized and always available. They can even automatically follow up to keep a customer engaged. 'Are you still interested in that large pizza?' .\nTo Ben, chatbots offer a huge opportunity to lawfirms who handle lay clients. Intake forms, client payment, and possibly more can all be automated via chatbot.\nColdewey breaks down the chatbot revolution in this article. %[NBCNews](http://bit.ly/NBCTalksBots)\nNow that you are a bot expert, what do you think?

    "YOUTH": "Ben grew up in Saint Joseph, Missouri with his two sisters, and a tight-knit extended family.\n![BolinFam](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BenAptus/EstherBot/master/img/bolinfam.jpg)\nBen's youth made him something of a factotum of experiences. In highschool he transformed from a longhaired teenager into a clean cut leader. During that time, Ben was recognized as a Voice of Democracy by the Veterans of Foreign Wars, he attended Missouri Boys State, competed in debate, and even directed his high school's first musical! %[HighSchool Musical](postback:High_School_Musical) %[Go Back](postback:Go_Back)",
    "HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL": "Ben spent much of his youth performing on stage. His acting career culminated in his performance at the Missouri State Theater's production of You Can't Take It With You.\nHe then became a student director for his high production of Annie. This was a huge undertaking for a school with very limited resources. But Ben worked with small teams to make one of the best shows the town had ever seen!\nIt was this experience that helped him realize his passion for problem solving and leadership that would later culminate in his undergraduate career. Would you like to hear about Ben's undergraduate career?

    "WHY JAPANESE?!": "On a trip to DisneyWorld his first semester of undergrad, Ben visisted the Japanese exhibit. Impressed, Ben resolved to study Japanese.\nHowever, it was too late to take the first year Japanese course. Not dissuaded, he selfstudied, and skipped the introductory classes to take Japanese year 2 that fall! However, his true test would come when he traveled to Japan. %[Oh Do tell](postback:oh_do_tell)",
    "OH DO TELL": "Ben has spent nearly six months in Japan. He lived two AMAZING host families.\n![114](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BenAptus/EstherBot/master/img/1003215_10201463161916810_2120169399_n.jpg)\nHe volunteered at the community center, and soon set to work creating the Winter Christmas Park.\nThere he was, standing at an abandoned elementary school no bigger than a gas station surrounded by Japanese locals. The mission was to transform this decreped building into a winter wonderland of lights. Ben was humbled by his failures due to language barrier. He placed lights in the wrong place, and would get in the way more than he could help. %[What did he do](postback:what_did_he_do)",
    "WHAT DID HE DO": "Ben rose to the challenge, studying fiercely each night the words and phrases he heard but couldn't understand. He asked for more clarification more often. He made friends. And before Ben knew it the old decrepit building was covered in lights and a buzz with children, performers, and food!\nThe night the lights were officially turned on, Ben and the Mayor of Iida hit the button together to cheers of the community.\nThis experience taught Ben the value of listening, community, and an appreciation for public service. %[Has he used his Japanese?](postback:Has_He_Used_His_Japanese?)",
    "HAS HE USED HIS JAPANESE?": "Yes! Ben has translated for Studio Rikka on the Time of Eve (a movie with over five international awards) english release. He has even performed traditional Japanese puppetry (人形浄瑠璃) as a main singer.\n![Taiyu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BenAptus/EstherBot/master/img/1173868_10201457992907588_550633403_n.jpg)\nConnect with Ben and talk about (or in) Japanese! %[I want to chat with Ben](postback:I_Want_to_Chat_with_Ben) %[Go Back](postback:Go_Back)",
    "INVOLVEMENT": "![BolinMSA](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BenAptus/EstherBot/master/img/Speaker022BW_jpg_900x600_q85.jpg)\nDuring his four years at Mizzou, Ben was involved in the University of Missouri student government known as the Missouri Students Association (MSA). During his involvement he represented the University of Missouri system in Washington DC to representatives, he even engaged other student government leaders at the SEC Exchange Conference. Ben was elected the Senate Speaker of the MSA Senate, where he worked tirelessly to serve the 71 senators.\nDuring his term, Ben's administration successfully lobbied for road improvements from the city, donated 3,500 pounds of food, and even recommended a new Vice Provost of Affairs. Not to mention managing a 1.7 million dollar budget. %[Sounds Like A Great Team](postback:sounds_like_a_great_team)",
    "SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT TEAM":"Ya! They absolutely were. Ben learned alot from them. He learned the value of communication, the sacrifice of determination, and alot about remembering to have fun.\nBut the projects, accomplishments (and failures!) don't stop there. You should talk with Ben about his involvement during his undergrad to learn more! %[I want to chat with Ben](postback:I_Want_to_Chat_with_Ben) %[Go Back](postback:Go_Back)",
    "WHY PHYSICS": "Discovery, for Ben, was a young boy turning over rocks to see what was underneath. Growing up, Ben's passion for exploration and discovery was unnapprent to him. His concepts of knowledge and experience were limited to getting Pikachu to level 60 on the Pokemon video games. Despite Ben's nerdy predisposition, he maintained, from very early on a strong curiosity and eagerness to understand the people and world around him.\nHis final year of highschool, he took his first physics class. It was an absolute challenge for him. Simple concepts were difficult for Ben, and he loved it. He explored 'the effects of friction' he discovered 'when two trains would crash'.\nIt was hard, but rewarding. Most importantly, Ben realized his innate passion for discovery and exploration. He decided physics was the best medium to realize that passion. %[Why Not Engineering](postback:why_not_engineering)",
    "WHY NOT ENGINEERING": "Good question. Engineering also helps explain the unexplained, and is very practical. Ben's adviser explained it best, 'it is easier to teach an engineering to a physicist, than to teach physics to an engineer.'\nPhysics is the building block to most all engineering. And with a physics degree, you can quickly learn almost any concept. Ben also couldn't choose between mechanical, electrical, or computer engineering. This is why Ben chose physics over any other science or engineering degree, because he could learn pieces of all of those degrees. And he got to discover more of the science behind the concepts taught in class.\nIn short, a physics degree equipped Ben to take on new challenges and learn new subjects quickly. You should chat with Ben about his Physics degree! %[I want to chat with Ben](postback:I_Want_to_Chat_with_Ben) %[Go Back](postback:Go_Back)",
