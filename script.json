    "ONE RANDOM FACT": "Ben only has one kidney! While most law students burn the midnight oil with caffeine, Ben has to monitor what he drinks. So instead of coffee, Ben stays energetic on pure determination!\n Want to chat about something else? %[I want to chat with Ben](postback:I_want_to_chat_with_Ben) %[Go Back](postback:Go_back)",
    "I WANT TO CHAT WITH BEN": "Awesome! Ben loves getting introductions from BolinBot. Feel free to tweet at him, dont be shy! Or, you can connect with him directly. Remember, Ben isn't as prompt as a chatbot (like me)! %[Tweet @BenBolin](http://bit.ly/BolinIntro) %[Connect Me Live](postback:connect_me)",
    "LEARN ABOUT BOTS": "I thought so. \n![capgif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BenAptus/EstherBot/master/img/capgif.gif)\nWant to learn how to make chatbots? Or how chatbots are the future? %[How to make chatbots](postback:How_to_make_chatbots) %[Chatbots in detail](postback:Chatbots_in_detail)", 
    "HOW TO MAKE CHATBOTS": "There are many ways to make a chatbot (and a million guides). Do you want the easy way or the hard (and rewarding) way? %[Easy Way](postback:easy_way) %[Hard Way](postback:hard_way)",
    "EASY WAY": "I (the bot) am inspired by an example bot made by Esther Crawford! This article details the steps to create your own chatbot. %[EstherBot](http://bit.ly/229jelu)\nWould you like to see other bots? Or are you done? %[Go Back](postback:Go_Back) %[There Are More Bots?!?](postback:There_Are_More_Bots?!?)",
    "HARD WAY": "Here is the hard(ish) way! This will get you a facebook messenger bot that echos what someone says. Its a great start! Then expand on the code to make the bot respond to specific words or phrases. %[Program Pair](http://bit.ly/ProgramPair)\nWould you like to see other bots? Or are you done? %[Go Back](postback:Go_Back) %[There Are More Bots?!?](postback:There_Are_More_Bots?!?)",
    "THERE ARE MORE BOTS?!?": "Haha. I know bots are cool. There are bots that will tell you the weather and bots that will tell you the news. Wanna try? \nIn facebook, go to the searchbar, and try one of the following: \n 1-800-flowers.com, CNN, Wall Street Journal. Click on 'Message' and see! \nAlright, are you satisfied? Otherwise connect with Ben and talk about chatbots! %[I want to chat with Ben](postback:I_Want_to_Chat_with_Ben) %[Go Back](postback:Go_Back)",
    "CHATBOTS IN DETAIL": "In short, bots can and will solve more problems, connect more people, and do more than any website or app.\nGet this: technology companies in Silicon Valley call the phenomina 'app fatigue', people download an app and either forget about it or don't use it. Social apps on the other hand are shown to be used more often and retained.\n![graph1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BenAptus/EstherBot/master/img/messaging-apps-retain-more-users-and-are-used-more-frequently-than-other-apps.jpg)\nEnter chatbots, short form artificial intelligence that can do anything an app can do but personalized and always available. They can even automatically follow up to keep a customer engaged. 'Are you still interested in that large pizza?' .\nTo Ben, chatbots offer a huge opportunity to lawfirms who handle lay clients. Intake forms, client payment, and possibly more can all be automated via chatbot.\nColdewey breaks down the chatbot revolution in this article. %[NBCNews](http://bit.ly/NBCTalksBots)\nNow that you are a bot expert, what do you think? Do you believe bots will replace apps? %[I am a bot believer](postback:I_am_a_bot_believer) %[I Hate Chatbots](postback:I_hate_chatbots)",

    "YOUTH": "Ben grew up in Saint Joseph, Missouri with his two sisters, and a tight-knit extended family.\n![BolinFam](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BenAptus/EstherBot/master/img/bolinfam.jpg)\nBen's youth made him something of a factotum of experiences. In highschool he transformed from a longhaired teenager into a clean cut leader. During that time, Ben was recognized as a Voice of Democracy by the Veterans of Foreign Wars, he attended Missouri Boys State, competed in debate, and even directed his high school's first musical! %[HighSchool Musical](postback:High_School_Musical) %[Go Back](postback:Go_Back)",
    "HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL": "Ben spent much of his youth performing on stage. His acting career culminated in his performance at the Missouri State Theater's production of You Can't Take It With You. He then became a student director for his high production of Annie. This was a huge undertaking for a school with very limited resources. But Ben worked with small teams to make one of the best shows the town had ever seen!\nIt was this experience that helped him realize his passion for problem solving and leadership that would later culminate in his undergraduate career.

    "WHY JAPANESE?!": "On a trip to DisneyWorld his first semester of undergrad, Ben visisted the Japanese exhibit. Impressed, Ben resolved to study Japanese.\nHowever, it was too late to take the first year Japanese course. Not dissuaded, he selfstudied, and skipped the introductory classes to take Japanese year 2 that fall! However, his true test would come when he traveled to Japan. %[Oh? Do tell!](postback:Oh?_Do_Tell)",
    "OH? DO TELL": "Ben has spent nearly six months in Japan. He lived two AMAZING host families.\n![114](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BenAptus/EstherBot/master/img/1149353_10151831153762938_302311836_o.jpg)\nHe volunteered at the community center, and soon set to work creating the Winter Christmas Park.\nThere he was, standing at an abandoned elementary school no bigger than a gas station surrounded by Japanese locals. The mission was to transform this decreped building into a winter wonderland of lights. Ben was humbled by his failures due to language barrier. He placed lights in the wrong place, and would get in the way more than he could help. [What did he do?](postback:What_did_he_do)",
    "WHAT DID HE DO": "Ben rose to the challenge, studying fiercely each night the words and phrases he heard but couldn't understand. He asked for more clarification more often. He made friends. And before Ben knew it the old decrepit building was covered in lights and a buzz with children, performers, and food!\nThe night the lights were officially turned on, Ben and the Mayor of Iida hit the button together to cheers of the community.\nThis experience taught Ben the value of listening, community, and an appreciation for public service. %[Has he used his Japanese?](postback:Has_He_Used_His_Japanese?)",
    "HAS HE USED HIS JAPANESE?": "Yes! Ben has translated for Studio Rikka on the Time of Eve (a movie with over five international awards) english release.
