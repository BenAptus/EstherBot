    "HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL": "Ben spent much of his youth performing on a stage. His acting career culminated in his performance at the Missouri State Theater's production of You Can't Take It With You. He then became a student director for his high school's production of Annie. This was a huge undertaking for a school with very limited resources.\nBut Ben worked with small teams to make one of the best shows the town had ever seen! It was this experience that helped him realize his passion for problem solving and leadership that would later culminate in his undergraduate career.

    "WHY JAPANESE?!": "On a trip to DisneyWorld his first semester of undergrad, Ben visited the Japanese exhibit. Impressed, Ben resolved to study Japanese. However, it was too late to take the first year Japanese course. Not dissuaded, he self studied, and skipped the introductory classes to take Japanese year 2 that fall!\nHowever, his true test would come when he traveled to Japan. %[Oh Do Tell](postback:oh_do_tell)",
    "OH DO TELL": "Ben has spent nearly six months in Japan. He lived with two AMAZING host families.\n![114](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BenAptus/EstherBot/master/img/1003215_10201463161916810_2120169399_n.jpg)\nIn Iida, Japan he volunteered at the community center, and soon set to work creating the Winter Christmas Park. There he was, standing at an abandoned elementary school no bigger than a gas station, surrounded by Japanese locals. The mission was to transform this decrepit building into a winter wonderland of lights.\nBen was humbled by his failures due to language barrier. He placed lights in the wrong place, and would get in the way more than he could help. %[What did he do](postback:what_did_he_do)",
    "WHAT DID HE DO": "Ben rose to the challenge, studying fiercely each night the words and phrases he heard but couldn't understand. He asked for more clarification more often. He made friends. And before Ben knew it the old decrepit building was covered in lights and a buzz with children, performers, and food!\nThe night the lights were officially turned on, Ben and the Mayor of Iida hit the button together to the cheers of the community. This experience taught Ben the value of listening, community, and an appreciation for public service. %[Has he done more?](postback:Has_He_Done_More?)",
    "HAS HE DONE MORE?": "Yes! Ben has translated for Studio Rikka on the Time of Eve (a movie with over five international awards) english release.

Ben's administration successfully lobbied for road improvements from the city, donated 3,500 pounds of food, and even recommended a new Vice Provost of Affairs. Not to mention managing a 1.7 million dollar budget. %[Wow Great Team](postback:Wow_Great_Team)",
    "WOW GREAT TEAM":"Ya! They absolutely were. Ben learned a lot from them.

You should talk with Ben about his involvement during his undergrad to learn more! %[Chat With Ben](postback:Chat_With_Ben) %[Go Back](postback:Go_back)",
    "WHY PHYSICS": "Discovery, for Ben, was a young boy turning over rocks to see what was underneath. Growing up Ben's passion for exploration and discovery was unapparent to him. His concept of knowledge and experience were limited to getting Pikachu to level 60 on the Pokemon video games.\nDespite Ben's nerdiness, he maintained a strong curiosity and eagerness to understand the people and world around him. His final year of high school, he took his first physics class. It was an absolute challenge for him. Simple concepts were difficult for Ben, and he loved it.\nHe explored 'the effects of friction' he discovered 'when two trains would crash'. It was hard, but rewarding. Most importantly, Ben realized his innate passion for discovery and exploration. He decided physics was the best medium to realize that passion. %[Why Not Engineering](postback:why_not_engineering)",
    "WHY NOT ENGINEERING": "Good question. Engineering also helps explain the unexplained. But Physics is the building block to most all engineering. Ben's adviser explained it best, 'a physics degree grants the ability to learn quickly and think critically.' With a physics degree, you can quickly learn almost any concept.\nThis is why Ben chose physics over any other science or engineering degree, because he could learn pieces of each degree. AND he got to discover more of the science behind the concepts taught in class!

    "WHY LAW SCHOOL": "Ben didn't even think about law school until he encountered a patent attorney. During his entrepreneurship, Ben met with a patent lawyer named Matt Kitzi. Ben was amazed by what Matt did everyday. Matt learned about new inventions, researched them, and then sought the best protection for innovators.\nBen loves to discover new things, and being a patent lawyer was a great medium to continually learn, discover, and help innovators like him! %[How does Ben feel now](postback:how_does_ben_feel_now)",
    "HOW DOES BEN FEEL NOW":"After some law school experience, Ben believes the practice of law is like his physics degree. In physics, he was given limited variables and told 'solve for x'. In the practice of law, a lot of what they do is 'solve for x' but also 'give every possible method to achieve x.'\nBen doesn't feel out of his element, but rather right where he was to begin with!

   "THERMOELECTRIC": "Thermoelectrics are devices made up of two dissimilar metals (one with more electrons than the other), when you apply a heat gradient (a difference in temperature) between the metals, electrons jump from one metal to the other creating electricity. Thermoelectrics are very similar to solar panels (sister technology).\nBen and his company used rapid prototyping and real world power plants to test their invention which used thermoelectrics for waste heat conversion. Ben has also used and adapted these devices as a lab assistant for the Institute for Nuclear Renaissance.

    "LEADERSHIP EXPERIENCE": "Ben has led students and teams to reach their full potential. Ben managed 70 senators as the Senate Speaker of his student government to pass a 1.7 million dollar budget. Ben has also lead a small multidisciplinary team to file two patents on a thermoelectric invention.\nIn law school he was treasurer of the Legal Technologists Society. They put on two large events this year, with over two dozen in attendance. He leads with energy, poise, and believes in 'leading by example.' %[A Leadership Story](postback:A_Leadership_Story) %[Go Back](postback:Go_Back)",
    "A LEADERSHIP STORY": "In undergrad, Ben recognized there were many problems persisting on campus. Organizations needed more involved members. Standing committees needed more student input. Ben believed a Think Tank was necessary to solve these issues. Ben reached out and received a flood of questions from many campus organizations. Ben then brought the team together. He encouraged all voices to speak. When the think tank started its discussions Ben selected members based on their individual strengths. Sometimes, that meant seeking an opinion from someone who had no idea about the problem. Or asking for an idea from members who rarely spoke. Bringing in those rarely heard voices highlighted major unforeseen sub-issues that were critical. The ideas shared were immediate. Institutional questions such as the role of subcommittees were redefined. The committee even helped grapple the phenomena of colleges stressing extracurricular activities over academic prowess to new students.\nIn total, the committee recommended and discussed over 70 issues from across campus. And led to many structural changes across campus. Without bringing out and playing the strengths of those individuals, the think tank would not have succeeded. You should talk to Ben about leadership for even more examples and stories! %[Chat With Ben](postback:Chat_With_Ben) %[Go Back](postback:Go_back)",
