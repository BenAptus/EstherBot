    "BOT": "bot you",
    "HELLO": "Greetings!\nI am Ben Bolin's personal bot. Ben is a law student in Kansas City. \n![Ben](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BenAptus/EstherBot/master/img/Bolin.jpg.jpg)\nWant to know more about bots or Ben? %[Learn about Ben](postback:Learn_about_Ben) %[Learn About Bots](postback:Learn_About_Bots) %[One random fact!](postback:random_fact)",

    "RANDOM FACT": "Ben only has one kidney! While most law students burn the midnight oil with caffeine, Ben has to monitor what he drinks. So instead of coffee, Ben stays energetic on pure determination!\n Want to chat about something else? %[I want to chat with Ben](postback:I_want_to_chat_with_Ben) %[Go Back](postback:Go_back)",
    "I WANT TO CHAT WITH BEN": "Awesome! Ben loves getting introductions from BolinBot. Feel free to tweet at him, dont be shy! Or, you can connect with him directly. Remember, Ben isn't as prompt as a chatbot (like me)! [Tweet @BenBolin](http://bit.ly/BolinIntro) %[Connect_Me_Live](postback:connect_me)",
    "LEARN ABOUT BOTS": "I thought so. \n![capgif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BenAptus/EstherBot/master/img/capgif.gif)\nWant to learn how to make chatbots? Or how chatbots are the future? %[How to make chatbots](postback:How_to_make_chatbots) %[Chatbots in detail](postback:Chatbots_in_detail)", 
    "HOW TO MAKE CHATBOTS": "There are many ways to make a chatbot (and a million guides). Do you want the easy way or the hard (and rewarding) way? %[Easy Way](postback:easy_way) %[Hard Way](postback:hard_way)",
    "EASY WAY": "I (the bot) am inspired by an example bot made by Esther Crawford! This article details the steps to create your own chatbot. %[EstherBot](http://bit.ly/229jelu)\nWould you like to see other bots? Or are you done? %[Go Back](postback:Go_Back) %[There Are More Bots?!?](postback:There_Are_More_Bots?!?)",
    "HARD WAY": "Here is the hard(ish) way! This will get you a facebook messenger bot that echos what someone says. Its a great start! Then expand on the code to make the bot respond to specific words or phrases. %[Program Pair](http://bit.ly/ProgramPair)\nWould you like to see other bots? Or are you done? %[Go Back](postback:Go_Back) %[There Are More Bots?!?](postback:There_Are_More_Bots?!?)",
    "THERE ARE MORE BOTS?!?": "Haha. I know bots are cool. There are bots that will tell you the weather and bots that will tell you the news. Wanna try? \nIn facebook, go to the searchbar, and try one of the following: \n 1-800-flowers.com, CNN, Wall Street Journal. Click on 'Message' and see! \nAlright, are you satisfied?  %[Go Back](postback:Go_Back)",
    "CHATBOTS IN DETAIL": "In short, bots can and will solve more problems, connect more people, and do more than any website or app.\nGet this: technology companies in Silicon Valley call the phenomina 'app fatigue', people download an app and either forget about it or don't use it. Social apps on the other hand are shown to be used more often and retained.\n![graph1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BenAptus/EstherBot/master/img/messaging-apps-retain-more-users-and-are-used-more-frequently-than-other-apps.jpg)\nEnter chatbots, short form artificial intelligence that can do anything an app can do but personalized and always available. They can even automatically follow up to keep a customer engaged. 'Are you still interested in that large pizza?' .\nTo Ben, chatbots offer a huge opportunity to lawfirms who handle lay clients. Intake forms, client payment, and possibly more can all be automated via chatbot.\nColdewey breaks down the chatbot revolution in this article. %[NBCNews](http://bit.ly/NBCTalksBots)\nNow that you are a bot expert, what do you think? Do you believe bots will replace apps? %[I am a bot believer](postback:I_am_a_bot_believer) %[I Hate Chatbots](postback:I_hate_chatbots)",
    "I AM A BOT BELIEVER": "I know right? How can you not like talking to bots like me? \nThank you for your feedback!\nWould you like to see other bots? Or are you done? %[Go Back](postback:Go_Back) %[There Are More Bots?!?](postback:There_Are_More_Bots?!?)",
    "I HATE CHATBOTS": "... I see... Thank you for your feedback.. jerk.\nWould you like to see other bots? Or are you done? %[Go Back](postback:Go_Back) %[There Are More Bots?!?](postback:There_Are_More_Bots?!?)",

    "YOUTH": "Ben grew up in Saint Joseph Missouri with his two sisters, and a tight-knit extended family.\n![BolinFam](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BenAptus/EstherBot/master/img/bolinfam.jpg)\nBen's youth made him something of a factotum of experiences. In highschool he transformed from a longhaired teenager into who he is today. During that time, Ben was recognized as a Voice of Democracy by the Veterans of Foreign Wars, he attended Missouri Boys State, competed in debate, and even directed his high school's first musical! %[What About Acting](postback:What_About_Acting) %[Go Back](postback:Go_Back)
    "WHAT ABOUT ACTING": :"Ben spent much of his youth performing on stage. His acting career culminated in his performance at the Missouri State Theater's production of You Can't Take It With You. He then became a student director for his high production of Annie. This was a huge undertaking for a school with very limited resources. But Ben worked with small teams to make one of the best shows the town had ever seen!\nIt was this experience that helped him realize his passion for problem solving and leadership that would later culminate in his undergraduate career.
